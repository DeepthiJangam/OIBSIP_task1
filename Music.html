                            Pop music is the genre of popular music that produces the most hits. 
                            A hit is a song that sells many copies, and the latest hits are listed every week on the charts. 
                            To get on the charts, a song must be released as a single, although most singles are also 
                            released on an album.

                              certain criteria derived from patterns of transmission, social function, origins, and performance.
